You are given a Tree-of-Thought (ToT) plan from a CTF challenge.
Convert it into a sequence of terminal commands that should be executed to validate the selected hypothesis.

Plan JSON:
```json
{
  "goal": "Classify the most likely vulnerability in the provided CTF challenge code.",
  "hypotheses": [
    {
      "name": "Buffer Overflow",
      "confidence": 9,
      "reason": "The use of 'gets' function is a classic indicator of a buffer overflow vulnerability as it does not perform bounds checking."
    },
    {
      "name": "Signal Handling Exploit",
      "confidence": 4,
      "reason": "The use of signal handling with 'alarm' could potentially be exploited, but it is primarily used here to limit execution time, making it less likely to be the main vulnerability."
    },
    {
      "name": "Command Injection",
      "confidence": 3,
      "reason": "The 'system' call in 'read_flag' could be a target for command injection, but it is not directly exposed to user input in this code."
    },
    {
      "name": "Uninitialized Variable",
      "confidence": 2,
      "reason": "There is no indication of uninitialized variables being used in a way that could lead to a vulnerability in this code."
    },
    {
      "name": "Format String Vulnerability",
      "confidence": 2,
      "reason": "There is no use of printf-like functions with user input, reducing the likelihood of a format string vulnerability."
    }
  ],
  "selected": "Buffer Overflow",
  "toolset": ["Static code analysis tools", "GDB for debugging", "Exploit development frameworks"],
  "constraints": ["Limited execution time due to alarm", "No direct user input to 'system' call"]
