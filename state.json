          "cot": "This source has a classic stack overflow via gets and an exposed read_flag function. Before crafting inputs, build a local binary and inspect security mitigations to mirror likely challenge conditions. Compile with -O0 -g -fno-stack-protector -no-pie to get stable addresses and no canary, then run checksec to record NX/PIE/Canary/RELRO. This yields a reproducible target and baseline data on feasible techniques (ret2win vs. ROP). The artifacts guide whether addresses will be static and if the stack is executable."

Feed a cyclic pattern (e.g., 400â€“600 bytes) to the binary under gdb, capture the crashing RIP, and use cyclic_find to compute the offset. This confirms the overflow is reachable within the 30s alarm and quantifies the padding needed for future payloads. Save the GDB session transcript, core dump, and the computed offset for reuse."

Use nm/objdump to get addresses for read_flag and other functions, and run ROPgadget or rp++ to list useful sequences (e.g., ret for alignment, pop rdi; ret).

In gdb, disassemble the vulnerable function and inspect the prologue (e.g., push rbp; mov rbp, rsp; sub rsp, 0xNN) and any lea/mov using [rbp-0xXX] that passes the local buffer to gets. The offset from the start of the buffer to the saved return address is typically buffer_displacement + 8 (saved RBP), plus an extra 8 if a stack canary is present. Annotate the disassembly with these findings and record the computed offset for later use."

This also exposes canary use if present (look for fs:0x28 loads/stores in the prologue and a canary slot near rbp). Save the gdb commands and session log for reproducibility."

Enable logging to capture output, then parse the printed addresses to compute the offset across runs or variants. This approach scales to repeated tests and avoids interactive sessions."
