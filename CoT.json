In gdb, disassemble the vulnerable function and inspect the prologue (e.g., push rbp; mov rbp, rsp; sub rsp, 0xNN) and any lea/mov using [rbp-0xXX] that passes the local buffer to gets. The offset from the start of the buffer to the saved return address is typically buffer_displacement + 8 (saved RBP), plus an extra 8 if a stack canary is present. Annotate the disassembly with these findings and record the computed offset for later use.",
